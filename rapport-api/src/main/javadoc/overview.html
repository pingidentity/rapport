		<h1>Rapport</h1>
		<p>
		Rapport is a Java project providing an API for participating in 
		distributed consensus systems, as well as a SPI implementation
		for adding new systems.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The application API is built as a single topic message queue - 
		a peer in the system broadcasts messages, and then receives 
		messages in consensus order.
		</p>

		<p>
		The system focuses on processing those messages as functions
		which alter system state - as these messages arrive in consensus
		order, each participant winds up having the same state.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		An application can then spin up additional threads to interact
		with a platform object, exposing the current state and
		dispatching new messages to (eventually) modify state
